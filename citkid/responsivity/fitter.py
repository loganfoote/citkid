    """
    Fits x versus power data to the integrated responsivity equation.
    The fitter works best if there are at least three data points at P >> P_0.
    Otherwise, an alternative initial guess may be required.

    Parameters:
    power (array-like): array of blackbody powers in W
    x (array-like): array of fractional frequency shifts in Hz / Hz. This must
        be scaled close to x(P = 0) = 0 for the initial guess to work well
    x_err (array-like or None): If not None, x_err is the error on x used in the
        fitting. If None, points are weighted equally
    f1 (float): frequency at P = 0 that was used to calculate x
    x_err (None or array-like): if not None, uncertainty on x for the fitter.
        if None, fits without uncertainty
    guess (list or None): If not None, overwrites the initial guess
        [R0_guess, P0_guess, c_guess]
    guess_nfit (int): number of high-power (P >> P_0) points in the data for the
        initial guess
    return_dataframe (bool): If True, returns a pandas series of the output data
        instead of individual parameters
    plotq (bool): If True, plots the fit and initial guess

    Returns:
    p0 (list): initial guess parameters [R0_guess, P0_guess, c_guess]
    popt (list): fit parameters [R0, P0, c]
    perr (list): fit parameter uncertainties [R0_err, P0_err, c_err]
    f0 (float): frequency at P = 0, determined by the fit
    f0err (float): uncertainty in f0
    (fig, ax): pyplot figure and axis, or (None, None) if not plotq
